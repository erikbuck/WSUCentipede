# WSUCentipede
iOS SpriteKit Centipede game slightly more full featured than the Android SpriteBatcher repository in this same account. This version was created to compare and contrast iOS development with Android development for a trivial game.

As with the Android game, it's best to run this game on a physical device for accurate performance and behavior.
